#About me


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designing and developing intelligent systems that harness the power of Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Conversational AI.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, how to make AI not just smarterâ€”but more useful. I'm exploring the craft of building AI that can think, decide, and interact like a human teammate. From generating human-like responses to designing AI agents that take action, Iâ€™m diving into the art of turning ideas into intelligent, responsive systems.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Impact-driven AI projects that aim to make a differenceâ€”whether itâ€™s in education, automation, assistive technologies, or sustainable innovations. I'm eager to work with creators, researchers, and developers who are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for guidance and exposure to new learning opportunities, research communities, and internships that push my boundaries in AI development.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to Generative AI, NLP, Conversational Interfaces, Agentic AI, or even early-stage product prototyping. Iâ€™m happy to share what Iâ€™ve learned through hands-on projects.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjai-s-180580241/). Iâ€™m always open to connect, collaborate, or brainstorm ideas!
